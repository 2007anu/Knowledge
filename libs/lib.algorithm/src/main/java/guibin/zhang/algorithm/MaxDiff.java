/**
 * Given an integer array, a diff is defined as one item substract the one on its right.
 * Please find the maximum diff among all these diffs.
 * For example: in the array {2, 4, 1, 16, 7, 5, 11, 9}, the max diff should be 11, namely 16 - 5
 * 
 * Please refer to http://zhedahht.blog.163.com/blog/static/2541117420116135376632/
 * 
 * Give h < i, diff[i]â‰¥number[h]-number[i], We need to find the max(diff[i])
 * If we have got the diff[i], How to get the diff[i+1]?
 * When we are finding the diff[i+1], we need to find the max before the No.i+1, 
 * There are two cases regarding this max, 
 * A) The max is the max before,
 * B) The max is the No.i
