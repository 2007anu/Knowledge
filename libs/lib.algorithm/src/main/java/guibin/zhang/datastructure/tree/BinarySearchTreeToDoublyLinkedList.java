/**
 * http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/TreeListRecursion.html
 * Here's the formal problem statement: 
 * Write a recursive function treeToList(Node root) that takes an ordered binary tree 
 * and rearranges the internal pointers to make a **circular doubly linked list** out of the tree nodes. 
 * The "previous" pointers should be stored in the "small" field 
 * and the "next" pointers should be stored in the "large" field. 
 * The list should be arranged so that the nodes are in increasing order. 
 * Return the head pointer to the new list. 
 * The operation can be done in O(n) time -- essentially operating on each node once. 
 * 
 * Hints:
 * Hint #1
 * The recursion is key. 
 * Trust that the recursive call on each sub-tree works 
 * and concentrate on assembling the outputs of the recursive calls to build the result. 
 * 
 * It's too complex to delve into how each recursive call is going to work -- trust that it did work and assemble the answer from there.
 * 
 * 
 * Hint #2
 * The recursion will go down the tree, recursively changing the small and large sub-trees into lists, 
 * and then append those lists together with the parent node to make larger lists. 
 * Separate out a utility function append(Node a, Node b) that takes two circular doubly linked lists 
 * and appends them together to make one list which is returned. 
 * Writing a separate utility function helps move some of the complexity out of the recursive function.
 * 
 * Hint #3
 * Trust that the recursive calls return correct output when fed correct input -- make the leap of faith. 
 * Look at the partial results that the recursive calls give you, and construct the full result from them. 
 * If you try to step into the recursive calls to think how they are working, you'll go crazy.
 * 
 * Hint #4
 * Decomposing out well defined helper functions is a good idea. 
 * Writing the list-append code separately helps you concentrate on the recursion which is complex enough on its own.
