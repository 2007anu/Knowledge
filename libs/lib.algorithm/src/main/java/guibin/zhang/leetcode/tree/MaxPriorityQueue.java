 * 
 * Binary heap: Array representation of a heap-ordered complete binary tree.
 * Basically binary heap is a complete binary tree.
 * 
 * Binary heap has features:
 * 1. Parent's key >= children's keys.
 * 
 * Array representation of the MaxHeap
 * 1. index starts from 1
 * 2. Take nodes in **level** order.
 * 3. No explicit link needed.
 * 
 * Attribute:
 * 1. Largest key is a[1], which is the root of the binary tree.
 * 2. Parent of node K is at K/2.
 * 3. Children of node K are at 2K and 2K + 1.
 * 
 * How to eliminate the violation:
 * 1. Exchange key in child with key in parent.
 * 2. Repeat until heap order restored.
