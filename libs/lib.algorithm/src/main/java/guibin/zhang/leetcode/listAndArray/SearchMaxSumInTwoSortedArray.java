/**
 * Two finite, strictly increasing, integer sequences are given. 
 * Any common integer between the two sequences constitute an intersection point. 
 * Take for example the following two sequences where intersection points are 
 * printed in bold: 
 * First  = 1 2 3 5 7 9 20 25 30 40 55 56 57 60 62 
 * Second = 1 4 7 11 14 25 44 47 55 57 100 
 * 
 * You can "walk" over these two sequences in the following way: 
 * 1. You may start at the beginning of any of the two sequences. Now start moving forward. 
 * 2. At each intersection point, you have the choice of either continuing with the same sequence youâ€™re currently on, or switching to the other sequence. 
 * The objective is to find a path that produces the maximum sum of data you walked over. 
 * 
 * In the above example, the largest possible sum is 453 which is the result of adding 
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 25, 44, 47, 55, 56, 57, 60, 62

 * 
 * This is just a slightly different take on the merge routine in merge sort. 
 * It does not require recursion nor does it require dynamic programming. 
 * It is implemented iteratively, with the efficiency being O(n+m), 
 * where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays. 
 * 
 * The basic idea is as follows: 
 * 1) Let A and B denote the two arrays 
 * 2) Let idxA be the current index of the array A, and let idxB be the current index of array B 
 * 3) While the element at the current index of A (i.e. A[idxA]) is 
 *    less then the element at the current index of B (B[idxB]) increment idxA, 
 *    and add each element to a running total (call it sumA) 
 * 4) Now that A[idxA] > B[idxB], increment idxB of B until B[idxB] is not less than A[idxA], 
 *    and also add it to a running total (call it sumB) 
 * 5) If at this point, A[idxA] is equal to B[idxB], we have found our intersection point. 
 *    So add the maximum of sumA and sumB i.e. max(sumA,sumB) to the totalresult. 
 *    Set sumA and sumB to zero, and repeat the whole process until all the elements in A and B have been examined.
